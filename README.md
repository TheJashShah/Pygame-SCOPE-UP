In this Grid World, you control the cross-hair of the scope of a rifle, and get the closest action-packed experience! 
Kill as many enemies as you can who spawn randomly to achieve control of the Grid just by their sheer number. Do not let too many of the pesky little shits be on the grid at the same time, or you will be harmed.

Shoot, Reload, Nuke, and Revive, but most importantly, have fun Blasting!

SCOPE-UP! to the Pressure.
